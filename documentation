Documentation:
The first traces that I received were the runtime traces for the simple subtraction function:
This application generated six STACK traces:
USING THIS CODE:
f1 = open("e1.txt", "r")
f2 = open("v1.txt", "r")
ctr = 0
for line1 in f1:
    ctr += 1
    for line2 in f2:
        if line1 == line2:  
            print("line ", ctr, ": same")
        else:
            print("line ", ctr, ":")
            print("  "+ "eclipse:", line1)
            print("  "+ "venus:", line2)
            print("")
        break
    if line1!=line2:
        print("OOPS")
        break
f1.close()                                       
f2.close()     
and changing the file names we assured that:
-the first stack traces file was exactly the same for both machines
-the second stack traces file was exactly the same for both machines
-the third stack traces file has line:

 -the forth stack traces file was exactly the same for both machines
-the fifth stack traces file was exactly the same for both machines
-the sixth stack traces file was exactly the same for both machines
For the runtime traces the traces generated from both traces are the same.
The second traces that I received were the runtime traces for the fake news detection function:
This application generated eleven runtime traces:
-the first runtime traces file were exactly the same for both machines
-the second runtime traces file were exactly the same for both machines
-the third runtime traces file were exactly the same for both machines
-the forth runtime traces file were exactly the same for both machines
-the fifth runtime traces file were exactly the same for both machines
-the sixth runtime traces file were exactly the same for both machines
-the seventh runtime traces file were exactly the same for both machines
-the eighth runtime traces file were exactly the same for both machines
-the nineth runtime traces file were exactly the same for both machines
-the tenth runtime traces file were exactly the same for both machines
-the eleventh runtime traces file were exactly the same for both machines
After that Dr. Gowri asked me to compare the runtime traces of all the applications:
I compared those of the addition function with each of the fake news one:
For the first runtime trace of the fake news: There was only one difference in the last line:
lines  6165 :
  eclipse: ->sub.py-><module>->1->100
  venus: ->prediction.py-><module>->6->100
For all other ten files the difference starts from the first line and this is due to the presence of import function.
